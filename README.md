# This is a Breast Cancer Classification model.(BC-Classification)

### It is used to classify the cancer as Malignat or Benign which are the two tumor cases in which we can decide whether it is cancerous or not.
## The classification has been done using both machine learning and deep learning models.

### For Machine Learning, I have used the logistic Regression model and a Neural network for Deep Learning. Both have achieved a great accuracy score.

#### Note that the data set for both the models is same.
