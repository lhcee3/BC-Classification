# This is a breast cancer classification model.

### It is used to classify the cancer as Malignat or Benign.

## The classification has been done using both machine learning and deep learning models.

### For machine I have used the logistic Regression model and a Neural network for deep Learning. Both have achieved a great accuracy score

#### Note that the data set for both the models is same.
